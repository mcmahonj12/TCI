How to use this script to deploy a vRO appliance from JSON.

1. Download the script folder to a system which can access the target vCenter Server where vRO will be deployed. i.e. C:\Scripts\Deploy-vRO.
2. Open the vrocdc01-config.json file. Update the properties with the deployment data that matches your deployment requirements.
3. Once the JSON has been updated, save the file for deployment usage.
4. Open PowerShell.
5. In the PowerShell CLI type "cd C:\Scripts\Deploy-vRO" and hit enter. Substitute C:\Scripts\Deploy-vRO with the desired path as necessary.
6. At the command prompt type ". .\Deploy-vRO.ps1" and hit enter. This will add the function to the PowerShell session.
7. Connect to the target vCenter Server with an administrator account; "Connect-VIServer -Server <target_vcenter_fqdn> -Credential (Get-Credential)"
8. Type "Deploy-vRO -JSONPath Deploy-vRO -JSONPath C:\Scripts\deploy-vro\vrocdc01-config.json" or change the JSON path to the location of your vRO config you created in step 2.
9. Monitor the deployment status. Once complete, the vRO appliance will power on. 
10. Log into the vRO appliance Control Center to complete setup.
