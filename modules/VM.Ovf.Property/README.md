# Credits
Additional credit must be given to some very helpful blogs and tools that made creating this module much easier.

William wrote the original PS1 and I just added the ability to get UserConfigurable status as well as change properties to UserConfigurable to TRUE. I then turned the script into a module for reuse. All the credit goes to William for creating the functions.
